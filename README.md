# NIIT_Project
this if a project designed by me for my NIIT graduation project using php for backend 
This is the README file for the Crypto Investment Site project. The project aims to develop a web application for managing and tracking cryptocurrency investments. The backend of the application is built using PHP, while the frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Overview
The Crypto Investment Site provides users with a platform to manage their cryptocurrency investments effectively. It allows users to create accounts, track their investment portfolios, view real-time market data, and make informed investment decisions.


The project is divided into two main components: the backend and the frontend.

Backend
The backend of the application is developed using PHP, a popular server-side scripting language. It handles the logic and data processing required for the application to function correctly. Key features of the backend include:

User authentication and authorization
Database management and interaction (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
API integration for real-time cryptocurrency data retrieval
Investment portfolio management
Transaction history tracking
Security measures (e.g., input validation, password hashing)
Frontend
The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system. Key features of the frontend include:

User registration and login forms
Dashboard displaying investment portfolio overview and performance
Real-time cryptocurrency market data display
Transaction history and portfolio management interfaces
Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices
